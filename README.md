The idea for the website came about when Alex was feeling lazy and didn't want to go to the store, but still wanted to make a dish with tzatziki, couscous and onions.He tried searching online for a recipe, but couldn't find one that fit his specific ingredients. That's when he decided to enter the ingredients into a language model like ChatGPT and found a recipe that looked delicious.

Back of the Fridge is a recipe website that helps users find recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. It provides a user-friendly, efficient and easy-to-use solution for users to find recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand.

Our team built the website "Back of the Fridge" using the React and Next.js frameworks for the frontend. These frameworks allowed us to create a user-friendly interface and provided a smooth navigation experience for our users. For the backend, we chose to use the Python programming language and the Flask web framework. This combination allowed us to build a robust and scalable backend that could handle a large number of requests. We also connected to the Cohere NLP API to process the input and output recipes. This API allowed us to quickly and easily extract the ingredients from the user's input and match them with the appropriate recipes from our database. The combination of React, Next.js, Python, Flask, and the Cohere NLP API allowed us to build a powerful and efficient recipe website that is able to provide users with the recipes they are looking for quickly and easily.

Building Back of the Fridge was a challenging task for our team as we had to integrate several third-party services to make the website work as intended. One of the biggest challenges we faced was the time crunch, as we had to complete the project within a tight deadline. One of the key components of the website is the integration of a natural language processing (NLP) API which helps to extract the ingredients from the user's input and match them with the appropriate recipes from our database. Integrating this API was a complex task as it required a lot of testing and fine-tuning to ensure that it was working correctly.
